HOLT : Good luck to you . [ applause ] Well , <span class="highlighted" id="node1">I do n't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight</span> , but I remind everyone , <span class="highlighted" id="node6">there are two more presidential debates scheduled</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node13">We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important , and we 're going to press for specifics</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node20">I am honored to have this role , but this evening belongs to the candidates and , just as important , to the American people</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node27">Candidates , we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions , as well as your visions and your values</span> . So , <span class="highlighted" id="node35">let 's begin</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node42">We 're calling this opening segment `` Achieving Prosperity</span> . '' <span class="highlighted" id="node50">And central to that is jobs</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node57">There are two economic realities in America today</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node64">There 's been a record six straight years of job growth , and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation</span> . However , <span class="highlighted" id="node90">income inequality remains significant , and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck</span>.Beginning with you , Secretary Clinton , <span class="highlighted" id="node101">why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works</span> ? <br><br>CLINTON : Well , <span class="highlighted" id="node108">thank you</span> , Lester , and <span class="highlighted" id="node113">thanks to Hofstra for hosting us</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node122">The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we 'll build together</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node127">Today is my granddaughter 's second birthday</span> , so <span class="highlighted" id="node136">I think about this a lot</span> . First , <span class="highlighted" id="node148">we have to build an economy that works for everyone , not just those at the top</span> . That means <span class="highlighted" id="node155">we need new jobs , good jobs , with rising incomes</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node166">I want us to invest in you</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node174">I want us to invest in your future</span> . That means <span class="highlighted" id="node185">jobs in infrastructure , in advanced manufacturing , innovation and technology , clean , renewable energy , and small business</span> , because <span class="highlighted" id="node190">most of the new jobs will come from small business</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node223">We also have to make the economy fairer</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node230">That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee , finally , equal pay for women 's work</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node241">I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node252">If you help create the profits , you should be able to share in them , not just the executives at the top</span>.And <span class="highlighted" id="node263">I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node270">I 've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you 're under</span> . So <span class="highlighted" id="node275">let 's have paid family leave , earned sick days</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node280">Let 's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node285">How are we going to do it</span> ? <span class="highlighted" id="node290">We 're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes</span>.Finally , <span class="highlighted" id="node323">we tonight are on the stage together , Donald Trump and I</span>. Donald , <span class="highlighted" id="node330">it 's good to be with you</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node337">We 're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node344">You have to judge us , who can shoulder the immense , awesome responsibilities of the presidency , who can put into action the plans that will make your life better</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node351">I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th</span>.<br><br>HOLT : Secretary Clinton , <span class="highlighted" id="node358">thank you</span>.Mr . Trump , <span class="highlighted" id="node402">the same question to you</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node381">It 's about putting moneyâ€”more money into the pockets of American workers</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node397">You have up to two minutes</span>.<br><br>TRUMP : <span class="highlighted" id="node415">Thank you</span> , Lester . <span class="highlighted" id="node422">Our jobs are fleeing the country</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node429">They 're going to Mexico</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node434">They 're going to many other countries</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node447">You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node458">They 're devaluing their currency</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node465">there 's nobody in our government to fight them</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node476">we have a very good fight</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node483">we have a winning fight</span> . Because <span class="highlighted" id="node496">they 're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node501">many other countries are doing the same thing</span>.So <span class="highlighted" id="node506">we 're losing our good jobs , so many of them</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node525">When you look at what 's happening in Mexico , a friend of mine who builds plants said it 's the eighth wonder of the world</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node536">They 're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world , some of the most sophisticated , some of the best plants</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node547">With the United States , as he said , not so much</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node552">So Ford is leaving</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node563">You see that , their small car division leaving</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node574">Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan , leaving Ohio</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node594">They 're all leaving</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node605">we ca n't allow it to happen anymore</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node622">As far as child care is concerned and so many other things , I think Hillary and I agree on that</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node631">We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we 're going to do , but perhaps we 'll be talking about that later</span>.But <span class="highlighted" id="node638">we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node674">We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and , with it , firing all of their people</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node685">All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node690">They leftâ€”fired 1,400 people</span> .<span class="highlighted" id="node703"> They 're going to Mexico </span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node710">So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node717">We can not let it happen</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node728">Under my plan , I 'll be reducing taxes tremendously , from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies , small and big businesses</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node739">That 's going to be a job creator like we have n't seen since Ronald Reagan</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node750">It 's going to be a beautiful thing to watch</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node757">Companies will come</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node765">They will build</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node772">They will expand</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node790">New companies will start</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node797">I look very , very much forward to doing it</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node809">We have to renegotiate our trade deals</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node816">we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs</span>.<br><br>HOLT : Secretary Clinton , <span class="highlighted" id="node841">would you like to respond</span> ? <br><br>CLINTON : Well , I think that <span class="highlighted" id="node834">trade is an important issue</span> . Of course , <span class="highlighted" id="node866">we are 5 percent of the world 's population ; we have to trade with the other 95 percent</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node873">we need to have smart , fair trade deals</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node884">We also , though , need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node891">the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again</span> . In fact , <span class="highlighted" id="node896">it would be the most extreme version , the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we 've ever had</span>.I call it <span class="highlighted" id="node901">trumped-up trickle-down , because that 's exactly what it would be</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node906">That is not how we grow the economy</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node911">We just have a different view about what 's best for growing the economy , how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes</span>.I think <span class="highlighted" id="node950">we come at it from somewhat different perspectives</span> . I understand that . You know , <span class="highlighted" id="node962">Donald was very fortunate in his life , and that 's all to his benefit</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node969">He started his business with $ 14 million , borrowed from his father</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node984">he really believes that the more you help wealthy people , the better off we 'll be and that everything will work out from there</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node991">I do n't buy that</span> .<br><br>CLINTON: <span class="highlighted" id="node2">I have a different experience</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node7">My father was a small-businessman</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node14">He worked really hard</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node43">He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and <span class="highlighted" id="node42">dump</span>ed the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going</span>.<br>And so <span class="highlighted" id="node60">what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node67">the better we will be off and the better we'll grow</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node72">That's the kind of economy I want us to see again</span>.<br><br><br><br>HOLT: Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can. <span class="highlighted" id="node48">You've talked about creating 25 million jobs</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node55">you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node62">How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node69">How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?</span><br><br>TRUMP: Well, for one thingâ€”and before we start on thatâ€”<span class="highlighted" id="node76">my father gave me a very small loan in 1975</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node81">I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node90">I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs</span>.<br><span class="highlighted" id="node97">Our country's in deep trouble</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node116">We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node151">They're the best</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node124">the best ever at it</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node129">What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing</span>.<br>So <span class="highlighted" id="node141">we have to do that</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node146">We have to renegotiate our trade deals</span>. And, Lester, <span class="highlighted" id="node178">they're taking our jobs</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node189">they're giving incentives</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node194">they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do</span>.<br><span class="highlighted" id="node211">Let me give you the example of Mexico</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node222">They have a VAT tax</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node227">We're on a different system</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node232">When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax</span>. When they sell inâ€”<span class="highlighted" id="node237">automatic, 16 percent, approximately</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node242">When they sell into us, there's no tax</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node247">It's a defective agreement</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node276">It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it</span>.<br>Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clintonâ€”yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.<br>But <span class="highlighted" id="node296">in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node303">She's been doing this for 30 years</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node317">why hasn't she made the agreements better?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node324">The NAFTA agreement is defective</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node331">Just because of the tax and many other reasons</span>, but just because of the fact...<br><br><br>HOLT : <span class="highlighted" id="node1">Let me interrupt just a moment</span> , but ... <br>TRUMP : <span class="highlighted" id="node13">Secretary Clinton and others , politicians , should have been doing this for years , not right now</span> , because of the fact that <span class="highlighted" id="node20">we 've created a movement</span> . They should have been doing this for years . <span class="highlighted" id="node42">What 's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is—look , we owe $ 20 trillion</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node49">We can not do it any longer , Lester</span>.<br>HOLT : <span class="highlighted" id="node56">Back to the question , though</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node61">How do you bring back—specifically bring back jobs , American manufacturers ?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node70">How do you make them bring the jobs back ? </span><br>TRUMP : Well , <span class="highlighted" id="node81">the first thing you do is do n't let the jobs leave</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node88">The companies are leaving</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node99">I could name</span> , I mean , <span class="highlighted" id="node106">there are thousands of them</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node113">They 're leaving</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node122">they 're leaving in bigger numbers than ever</span>.And what you do is you say , fine , <span class="highlighted" id="node133">you want to go to Mexico or some other country</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node140">good luck</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node164">We wish you a lot of luck</span> .

That <span class="highlighted" id="node376">was in large part because of tax policies</span> that<span class="highlighted" id="node315"> slashed taxes on the wealthy</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node326">failed to invest in the middle class</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node339">took their eyes off of Wall Street</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node350">created a perfect storm</span>.In fact , <span class="highlighted" id="node391">Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node436">He said , back in 2006 , `` Gee , I hope it does collapse , because then I can go in and buy some and make some money . ''</span> Well ,<span class="highlighted" id="node451"> it did collapse</span>.<br>TRUMP : <span class="highlighted" id="node465">That 's called business , by the way</span>.<br>CLINTON : Nine million people—<span class="highlighted" id="node472">nine million people lost their jobs</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node479">Five million people lost their homes</span> .
